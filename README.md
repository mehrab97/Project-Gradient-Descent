# Project-Gradient-Descent
This project is divided into 2 parts

## Part 1
Gradient Descent - Combined Cycle Power Plant
Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

## Part-2
Gradient Descent - Boston Dataset
Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.

Tried and coded Gradient Descent for N features and came up with predictions.
Tried and tested with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
Tried using Feature Scaling, and saw if it helps in getting better results. 

This project was done as a part of Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by Coding Ninjas.
